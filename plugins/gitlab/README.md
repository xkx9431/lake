## Configuration

### Provider (Datasource) Connection
The connection aspect of the configuration screen requires the following key fields to connect to the **GitLab API**. As GitLab is a _single-source data provider_ at the moment, the connection name is read-only as there is only one instance to manage. As we continue our development roadmap we may enable _multi-source_ connections for GitLab in the future.

- **Connection Name** [`READONLY`]
  - ⚠️ Defaults to "**Gitlab**" and may not be changed.
- **Endpoint URL** (REST URL, starts with `https://` or `http://`)
  - This should be a valid REST API Endpoint eg. `https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/`
  - ⚠️ URL should end with`/`
- **Personal Access Token** (HTTP Basic Auth)
  - Login to your Gitlab Account and create a **Personal Access Token** to authenticate with the API using HTTP Basic Authentication.. The token must be 20 characters long. Save the personal access token somewhere safe. After you leave the page, you no longer have access to the token.

    1. In the top-right corner, select your **avatar**.
    2. Select **Edit profile**.
    3. On the left sidebar, select **Access Tokens**.
    4. Enter a **name** and optional **expiry date** for the token.
    5. Select the desired **scopes**.
    6. Select **Create personal access token**.

For help on **Creating a personal access token**, please see official [GitLab Docs on Personal Tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html)
    
For an overview of the **GitLab REST API**, please see official [GitLab Docs on REST](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/restful_api_styleguide.html#restful-api)
    
Click **Save Connection** to update connection settings.
    
### Provider (Datasource) Settings
Manage additional settings and options for the GitLab Datasource Provider. Currently there is only one **optional** setting that allows you to Map multiple JIRA Boards to GitLab Projects.

- **JIRA Board Mappings [ `Optional`]**
**Map JIRA Boards to GitLab**. Type comma separated mappings using the format `[JIRA_BOARD_ID]:[GITLAB_PROJECT_ID]`
```
# Map JIRA Board ID 8 ==> Gitlab Projects 8967944,8967945
<JIRA_BOARD>:<GITLAB_PROJECT_ID>,...; eg. 8:8967944,8967945;9:8967946,8967947
```
Click **Save Settings** to update additional settings.

## Gathering Data with Gitlab

To collect data, you can make a POST request to `/pipelines`

```
curl --location --request POST 'localhost:8080/pipelines' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '
{
    "name": "gitlab 20211126",
    "tasks": [[{
        "plugin": "github",
        "options": {
            "projectId": <Your gitlab project id>
        }
    }]]
}
'
```

## Finding Project Id

To get the project id for a specific `Gitlab` repository:
- Visit the repository page on gitlab
- Find the project id just below the title

> Use this project id in your requests, to collect data from this project

## ⚠️ (WIP) Create a Gitlab API Token <a id="gitlab-api-token"></a>

1. When logged into `Gitlab` visit `https://gitlab.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens`
2. Give the token any name, no expiration date and all scopes (excluding write access)

3. Click the **Create Personal Access Token** button
4. Save the API token into `.env` file via `cofnig-ui` or edit the file directly.
